## Running Locally
To run the application locally and access it in your browser, first set the PORT environment variable to the value of your choice. An example is shown below.
export PORT=7000
After the PORT environment variable has been set, run the Node.js application with the command below.
node server.js
The application will now be running locally on PORT, in this case that is port 3030. You can then access it locally from your browser at the URL localhost:PORT, in this case localhost:7000.
